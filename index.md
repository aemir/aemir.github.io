# Dilbert

Dilbert is a fictional character and the main character and protagonist of the comic strip of the same name. The character has ideas which are typically sensible and occasionally even revolutionary, but they are rarely pursued because he is powerless. He is frustrated by the incompetence and malevolence of his co-workers (most often the Pointy-Haired Boss) and often is sarcastic and snide. (Text shameless stolen from wikipedia.)
